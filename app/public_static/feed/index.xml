<p id="058e">Last December I found myself coming into work early while my kids were out for Christmas break to get a head start on my day. Instead of answering emails or estimating projects, I was using the quiet time to draw on our large whiteboard walls. I was careful to try and draw in an empty office because I wasn’t sure if they might be seen as a waste of time. The idea of drawing whiteboard murals was pretty simple, I had been in a design leadership position for a little while and i missed making things. They were always meant to be temporary and fun. After a few drawings like the three above got labeled as things like “great for the office culture” instead of a waste of time like i feared, I decided to take on a new year’s resolution project. I would do one whiteboard a week for the year, so here are all 52 whiteboards. Some of these have stories and some don’t. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, Ill try not to write too much and let them speak for themselves.</p>



<h1 id="6918"><strong>1 &#8211; No Riding the Velociraptors, Kelly</strong></h1>



<p id="309d">This week started by overhearing a conversation between designers joking about office rules being posted on the doors of a popular collaboration space. I thought we needed one more rule. When the drawing was nearing completion, we decided that the rider resembled a coworker so the purple hair was replaced to round out the likeness of our good friend Kelly.</p>

<h1 id="947d">2 &#8211; New Years</h1>



<p id="b03b">A belated new year’s party gave me about 30 minutes one morning to scribble out some fireworks.</p>

<h1 id="3f09"><strong>3 &amp; 4 &#8211; David Bowie and Allan Rickman</strong></h1>



<p id="05d8">2016 seemed to bring a lot of bad news. The first was the passing of David Bowie. I didn’t plan on a series of tributes, but Alan Rickman’s death a week later was one that had to get it’s own board too. The day after the second drawing, a coworker quickly pointed out that Snape’s patronus was actually a doe so i quickly fixed it. I just didn’t take a photo of it.</p>

<h1 id="5cd7"><strong>5 &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Fill in the Blank Apes</strong></h1>



<p id="ee85">It only took a month, but there were some folks who felt the need to add their own artwork to these drawings, so I gave everyone a space to add their own part.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="700" src="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_X0tYGKhElP6E0itF5dy48Q.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-113" srcset="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_X0tYGKhElP6E0itF5dy48Q.jpg 700w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_X0tYGKhElP6E0itF5dy48Q-300x300.jpg 300w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_X0tYGKhElP6E0itF5dy48Q-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h1 id="dbb9">6 &amp; 7 &#8211; Don’t Krill my Vibe and Shuttle Launch</h1>



<p id="c8aa">With a few new neon whiteboard markers and a day of consecutive meetings in one room, I started thinking about all the strange things going on around the office, things going on right under the surface. I guess it’s not a secret anymore. I applied for a new job this week.</p>



<p id="a3c0">I also started to experiment with some of the other whiteboards around the office. One of the rooms near my desk had the big board that was rarely use. I had big plans for a space shuttle launch mural that might last a little while. I was so wrong, it was all erased withing a few hours. I’m not sure if John even noticed me drawing around him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="339" src="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_Qp-fJHTjlrCNIhrxYC655A.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-114" srcset="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_Qp-fJHTjlrCNIhrxYC655A.jpg 700w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_Qp-fJHTjlrCNIhrxYC655A-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h1 id="0a41">8 &#8211; The whole world</h1>



<p id="17e7">The biggest board in the building needed something really large, and honestly, I was starting to think about traveling to places like Scottland a little bit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="700" src="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_O39_NYQoKY-JX-ftrRboUw.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-115" srcset="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_O39_NYQoKY-JX-ftrRboUw.jpg 700w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_O39_NYQoKY-JX-ftrRboUw-300x300.jpg 300w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_O39_NYQoKY-JX-ftrRboUw-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h1 id="24f0">9 &amp; 10 &#8211; Bugs</h1>



<p id="4a14">This week I watched a team of good people argue extensively over 7 bugs logged in Jira for a project that had been going on for longer than it should have. After last weeks board met the fate of a whiteboard eraser, this weeks was meant to. Every bug on this board represents one of those 7 bugs, when the developers cleared a ticket, they get to erase a bug.</p>



<p id="9b1d">The erase-the-bugs game turned into a drawing of it’s own, a fun and messy drawing that ended with a new mobile web application being launched. Maybe this whole marker drawing thing is more than just a little fun.</p>

<h1 id="60ab">12 &#8211; 17 &#8211; All the Owls</h1>



<p id="8c1d">My buddy Brad got really freaked out by some of these drawings because he thought they we’re watching him. Just for him, I drew a bunch of owls as high as i could in every room I could find. I gave them all giant eyes and and one accidentally ended up looking like Bernie Sanders.</p>

<h1 id="ab37">23 &amp; 24 &#8211; Goodbye Noah and Welcome Micah</h1>



<p id="0f49">This is the series of weeks where everything started moving. One of the most talented designers on my design team turned in his resignation to go out on his own. Noah was a huge Zelda fan so we had to try and make him cry with a Link themed goodbye board. As sad as it was, the move gave us a chance to bring one of our super talented contract designers on full time. Micah may have actually rode into work on an elephant on his first day. This was also about the time that I knew I’d be leaving my job but i couldn’t really tell anyone yet.</p>

<h1 id="c56b">26 &#8211; Be Fearless</h1>



<p id="e0b7">This was a significant whiteboard. It was the last one I drew at St. Jude. Most of my work had been wound down and i thought i should try and give the guys one last bit of cheesy dad advice.</p>

<h4>Our Approach</h4>



<p>Sites this size don’t get redesigned as a project. They are long-term, ongoing engagements. Our experience design team approached this work by focusing on our user’s biggest problems. Years of research and feedback gave us the insights to understand where their primary points of friction occurred. Our strategy was to use their perspective to guide how and what we designed</p>



<h4>Integrating Research</h4>



<p>With a wealth of research and analytics on how users behaved in the past, we wanted to regularly leverage our XDR partners to help us understand evolving problems and needs as well as validate the usability and product market fit of our work.</p>



<p>My role on this included facilitating workshops, a little prototyping, as well as leading the design, UX, and content strategy teams.</p>

<h4>Design Brief</h4>



<p>This program was very successful offline. We needed to make the digital experience as clear and frictionless as purchasing a ticket on the phone.</p>



<ul>
<li>increase overall engagement</li>



<li>promote secondary prizes per market</li>



<li>publicize the sponsors that made this program possible</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="300" src="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-workshop.5a18446b.png" alt="" class="wp-image-97" srcset="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-workshop.5a18446b.png 600w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-workshop.5a18446b-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<h4>User Behavior</h4>



<p>Based on our existing qualitative research, we began this project with a few assumptions about the users of this product.</p>



<ul>
<li>they purchased tickets to support the Mission</li>



<li>they learned of the program from their local news</li>



<li>they didn&#8217;t understand local lottery regulations</li>



<li>they didn&#8217;t understand secondary prizes</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="300" src="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-agile.e1f5f1a8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-98" srcset="http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-agile.e1f5f1a8.png 600w, http://johnlloyd.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dreamhome-agile.e1f5f1a8-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<h4>Unique Challenges</h4>



<p>Our primary objective was to sell Dream Home tickets but program regularly sold out in each market, The application also needed to:</p>



<ul>
<li>increase overall engagement</li>



<li>promote secondary prizes per market</li>



<li>publicize the sponsors that made this program possible</li>
</ul>

<p id="1858">It’s that time of year again. Optional school applications were made available for pickup starting at 6 a.m. on Monday, January 25th. This has been one of those odd “Only in Memphis” traditions that we’ve all heard has been going on forever; The optional schools, parent-organized, sidewalk camp outline at the board of education.</p>



<p id="4ea7">Shelby County Schools offers multiple optional programs across the district. Some of them specialize in college preparation, others in performing arts or even aviation. Any parent zoned for a Shelby County School can apply for one of these optional schools on a first-come-first-served basis and parents literally line up days in advance for some of the schools they deem more desirable with limited availability.</p>



<p id="8404">I set out to write something about our experience so parents that wanted to do this next year might know what it was like, but after two days, I didn’t think I could improve on&nbsp;<a href="http://eastmemphismoms.com/your-city/the-2015-optional-campout-one-dads-story/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Seth’s post on the East Memphis Mom’s blog</a>&nbsp;from last year. He did briefly mention the very redundant discussions about the process which drove many parents into their tents so they could avoid having it over and over again. I thought I could talk a little about those and hopefully add a little to it.</p>



<p id="d867">Every year around this event, the same conversations are had. Officials at Shelby County Schools will tell everyone that there is no need to start a line multiple days in advance, and that 99.9% of barcoded applications are accepted into one of the schools of their choice. Parents that don’t have the means to leave their lives for multiple days will say that the first-come-first-served system of prioritizing applications is a disadvantage to them. Critics on social media will argue that the line is a system that usually lets kids with some advantages gain even more advantages. Parents that do choose to line up will say that they want to offer their child the best educational opportunity they can and many of them believe that optional schools are just that. Most of them will say it’s a better option than private school or the municipal school districts. Parents who aren’t aware of the line starting early will arrive on Monday morning and be frustrated that there are hundreds of people that lined up days in advance. Everyone will agree that there could be a better system but that’s usually where conversations fizzle out.</p>

<p id="c78f">I fall into the category of parents that are opting for the campout line and plenty of people have already asked why. Why did I go stand in a line 6 days before the applications come out if 99.9% of applicants get accepted into one of the schools of their choice?</p>



<p id="78f4">The short answer is, I’m in line for a spot in one school. We have multiple schools we’d be very happy to have our son attend but we have a clear first choice.</p>



<p id="d610">There are 100 spots open for the 6th grade at Maxine Smith STEAM Academy. 50 of those spots will be reserved for students within a 2 mile radius if they qualified and 20 spots would be selected by a lottery if more than 100 total students qualified. That leaves 30 spots that we know will be open and some of those will go to siblings of current students. By lunch time on Wednesday (6 days in advance) there were already over 50 parents in line for those spots. By Thursday there were over 80 parents on the list, with 60+ saying they wanted in the new optional middle school. By Monday morning when the doors opened, It was hard to count but I would guess that number was over 500.</p>

<p id="9b22">The news stations love to come cover this story and they usually hit all those major points mentioned above, but there are a few that are talked about a little less loudly. It took a little asking around but one of the parents had a list of all the optional schools and told us that there were over 6,400 openings in the 47 schools offering optional transfers and a little over 2,700 applications were turned in last year. If those numbers are correct, it starts to make sense where the 99.9% number comes from. There certainly isn’t a shortage of spots across the district.</p>



<p id="1525">Another common conversation is about the many alternatives. The two common ones suggested both remove the first-come-first-served approach. One is to go to a completely merit-based system where students with the top grades get the first selections. The common critique of this method is the over-emphasis on standardized testing and the disadvantage it would give kids that are currently in struggling schools. The second alternative commonly suggested is a lottery. The parents that oppose the lottery idea argue that it leaves them completely helpless and gives them no way to try and get their kids into a better school. They don’t want to leave it 100% up to chance. Each solution solves one problem and leaves critics of another.</p>



<p id="0596">I have a different option that I’d love the school board to consider. It isn’t terribly different than the one in place now and doesn’t remove the first-come-first-served system. Priority is already given to students that live in a certain radius and to students with siblings already attending the school. For the open enrollment process later in the year, priority is also given to students in nearby failing schools. There are clearly parents like myself that will spend time, energy, and money to get the best opportunities for their children. Why not give them an opportunity to do that in a way that benefits the children in the school system rather than reward their ability to form and govern a line on the sidewalk in January? My idea doesn’t solve all the problems the way a few more great schools would, but I think it may offer an alternative to the line and point some of these parents in a more productive direction. I propose that a priority rule be added that bumps parents to the front of the line if they volunteer at those same schools that so many of them want to transfer from. It could also be extended to a list of schools that the Board of Education thinks could benefit from those parents’ service hours.</p>



<p id="f742">As of Thursday, there were 80 parents willing to give up a week of their lives and sleep on a sidewalk. The school board actually insisted on us leaving because of impending winter weather. I’d be willing to bet they’d give up that much time or more over the school year to volunteer as a crossing guard, talk with high schoolers interested in careers similar to their own, scrape gum off the bottoms of desks, tutor or any number of things our school administrators needed if it leads to the opportunities they wanted for their own kids. I know it’s not as simple as that. How much would a parent need to volunteer to get into this priority group? What happens if 300 parents do this and they all want those 30 spots? What if people lie about how much they volunteered? There are lots of details that would need to be figured out, but I think a few smart people can refine a system to test.</p>



<p id="e10d">I suggest that we try a little experiment for the 2017 application process. Let’s pick one school for next year, maybe one like STEAM. Let’s pick a number of hours, maybe we could start at 50 or even 100 and they have to be signed off on by a principal. Then let’s pick a level of priority to give to parents who choose this route, maybe after siblings but before the campers.</p>



<p id="616e">My hypothesis is that parents would choose to pursue getting on this priority list as opposed to getting in line early. If they don’t, no harm, no foul. If they do, it will help until bigger problems are solved and you could roll it out to more schools in 2018. The worst possible outcome is that too many parents get involved in investing time into local public schools and they can’t all fit into the available spots in their preferred choices. Wouldn’t that be an interesting problem to solve?</p>



<p id="e5cd">Maybe this is a terrible idea but I hope this starts a conversation about a better way to offer the same great programs to parents and students that I benefited from as a Memphis City Optional School Student for 13 years at Sherwood, Colonial, and Overton.</p>
